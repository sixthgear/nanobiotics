DEPENDENCIES:

If you decide to run from the source, you'll need the following depdencies:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/ (developed using 2.7.2, 32bit) 
  Pyglet:     http://www.pyglet.org/ (1.1.4)
  Rabbyt:     http://arcticpaint.com/projects/rabbyt/ (0.8.3)
  Lepton:     http://code.google.com/p/py-lepton/ (1.0b2)
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/ (1.9.1) (optional for gamepad support)
  AVBIN:      http://code.google.com/ (optional, but strongly recommended (lots
              of effort put into our music))

We've had the best luck with 32bit versions of everything, even on 64bit
machines.

RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows:
    Locate and launch Nanobiotics.exe.

On Mac OS X:
    Locate and run the standalone launcher Nanobiotics.app

Linux:
    This hits a grey area, best bet is to use a 32bit version of python and
    download prepackaged versions of the libraries and not install them
    globaly. I'll package this up once I can feel my fingers again :)

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Move the crosshair around the screen with the mouse: Button 1 will shoot, while
button 2 will save you if you have bombs in your inventory. Use WASD to control 
the ship's movement.  Enemies have two states, mostly harmless and a super
charged  mutated form where they are faster, more aggressive, and able to take
more punches. Dispatch them before they destroy your ship.


NOTES:

We hope you enjoy the game, we had a blast creating it. Also: we're not done!
So many cool features had to be dropped to get this out the door on time. Keep
an eye on our source respository, because we will continue working on it!
